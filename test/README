I have used python3.4 for programming the given assignment.
The programs can be executed using the below commands:
python3 interval.py
python3 lcs.py

Alternatively these can be executed using the make file with the commands
make -f MAKEFILE testinterval
make -f MAKEFILE testlcs

Test files have also been provided.
For interval.py, the input file is input_interval.txt
For lcs.py, the input file is lcsinput.txt
